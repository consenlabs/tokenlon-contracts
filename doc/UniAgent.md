# UniAgent

UniAgent is a shortcut for integrating Uniswap procotol. The first step of executing a swap is collecting input token from a user. Then the contract calls one of Uniswap routers with user specified payload. Although it's funtionalidty can be covered by GenericSwap contract but UniAgent is more friendly to simple or small swap because of lower gas consumption.
